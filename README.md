# Watch_Scraper

## Project Description

This is a Python-based automation project that scrapes **watch data from Flipkart**, filters results by price (default: under â‚¹2000), and saves them into an **Excel file**.  
The project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts along with modern scraping tools like **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**.

## Features

- **Automated Data Fetching:** Scrapes product details (watch name, brand, price, availability) from Flipkart.  
- **Price Filtering:** Automatically filters results under a configurable price limit.  
- **Data Export:** Saves the final dataset to an Excel file (`watch_data.xlsx`).  
- **Headless Browser:** Uses Selenium WebDriver with headless mode to handle dynamic content.  
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully manages bot detection, timeouts, and parsing issues.  

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python (3.8+)  
- **Libraries:** Selenium, BeautifulSoup4, Pandas, OpenPyXL, Webdriver-Manager  
- **Browser:** Chrome / Chromium
